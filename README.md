# Chinook-Music-Store
This project demonstrates how structured data analysis can guide strategic decision-making in the physical music retail industry. Using SQL and MySQL Workbench, we transformed Chinook’s raw transaction, customer, and product data into powerful business insights across three key pillars: Customer, Product, and Location. Through a series of complex SQL queries, window functions, ranking logic, and churn modeling techniques, we uncovered hidden trends in purchasing behavior, regional performance variations, and product-level affinities.
From transactional noise emerged a structured narrative—one that moves beyond surface-level sales numbers to reveal what customers buy, how often they buy, and why they stop buying. This wasn’t just about exploring a database - it was about listening to what the data was saying and letting it inform marketing, merchandising, and regional strategies. By tying together transactional depth with behavioral segmentation, this project equips Chinook with not just insights, but a scalable decision framework for product promotion, retention targeting, and regional investment. The final outcome is a full analytical report and a presentation deck ready for stakeholders, built not on assumptions, but on repeatable, query-backed logic. Now, as Chinook tunes into its market’s rhythms more precisely than ever, these insights offer not just clarity, but competitive edge - guided by patterns, not opinions.
